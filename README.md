# Arkadia

Arkadia monitors home environment conditions — temperature, pressure, humidity, CO₂, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and ambient sound — using sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi 5.  Readings are published to a local MQTT broker, exposed via a REST/WebSocket API, and displayed on a retro-styled web dashboard.

Named after the base camp of the Skaikru in [The 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_100_(TV_series)).

```

Sensor services publish retained JSON payloads to a local Mosquitto broker.  The API service subscribes to all sensor topics, maintains the latest readings in memory, and exposes them over HTTP and a WebSocket endpoint for real-time audio streaming.

See [`docs/tech-design.md`](docs/tech-design.md) for the full technical design and [`docs/dev-plan.md`](docs/dev-plan.md) for the implementation history.

## Sensors

| Sensor  | Interface | I2C Address | Topic                         | Measurements                        |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| BME280  | I2C       | `0x76/0x77` | `home/sensors/climate/bme280` | Temperature, humidity, pressure     |
| SCD40   | I2C       | `0x62`      | `home/sensors/air/scd40`      | CO₂, temperature, humidity          |
| SGP40   | I2C       | `0x59`      | `home/sensors/air/sgp40`      | VOC Index (Sensirion scale 1–500)   |
| INMP441 | I2S       | —           | `home/sensors/audio/inmp441`  | Ambient sound (RMS / dBFS)          |

The audio service also publishes a real-time stream at `home/sensors/audio/inmp441/stream` (QoS 0, non-retained, 20 Hz) for the WebSocket visualizer.

All sensors publish an online/offline status to `home/status/{sensor_id}` via MQTT Last Will and Testament.

## Deploying on Raspberry Pi

### First-time setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/malonge/Arkadia
cd Arkadia
sudo bash scripts/setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` handles everything in one pass:
- Installs system packages (`mosquitto`, `python3-venv`, `i2c-tools`, `nodejs`, etc.)
- Configures and starts Mosquitto
- Enables I2C via `raspi-config`
- Configures I2S for the INMP441 microphone in `/boot/firmware/config.txt`
- Creates a Python virtualenv for each service and installs its dependencies
- Scaffolds `/etc/home-monitor.env` with `ARKADIA_ROOT` and a placeholder `MONITOR_API_KEY`

After setup, set a real API key:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/home-monitor.env
# Set MONITOR_API_KEY to a strong random value, e.g.:
# python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

If the I2S lines were added to `/boot/firmware/config.txt`, reboot before continuing.

### Deploy

```bash
sudo bash scripts/deploy.sh
```

Builds the web dashboard, refreshes all Python virtualenvs, copies unit files, fixes `User=` to the actual username, enables all services, and starts them in dependency order (`mosquitto` → sensors → `api`). Safe to re-run after any code or config change — virtualenvs and the web build are always refreshed.

Once `deploy.sh` completes, open **`http://raspberrypi.local:8000/`** in your browser. The dashboard loads automatically on every boot without any manual steps.

### Verify all services are up

```bash
systemctl status bme280 scd40 sgp40 audio api
journalctl -u sgp40 -f          # follow logs for one service
mosquitto_sub -h 127.0.0.1 -t 'home/sensors/#' -v    # watch all readings
mosquitto_sub -h 127.0.0.1 -t 'home/status/#' -v     # watch connectivity
i2cdetect -y 1                  # should show 0x59, 0x62, 0x76/0x77
```

For detailed per-service deployment steps and troubleshooting, see [`skills/pi-deployment.md`](skills/pi-deployment.md).

## Web Dashboard

The dashboard is a Svelte + Vite app served from the API at `http://<pi>:8000/` (after PR 12 merges; during development, run it separately on port 5173).

**Development (SSH tunnel from your Mac):**

```bash
# Mac terminal — forward both ports
ssh -L 5173:localhost:5173 -L 8000:localhost:8000 micheldelving@<pi-ip>

# Pi terminal — start the dev server
cd ~/Projects/Arkadia/web
npm install       # first time only
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.  The first load shows a settings modal — enter your `MONITOR_API_KEY`.

**Panels:**

| Panel | Sensor | Displays |
|-------|--------|---------|
| CLIMATE | BME280 | Temperature gauge (16 pixel blocks, color-coded) + humidity + pressure |
| AIR QUALITY | SCD40 + SGP40 | CO₂ bar meter + temperature/humidity; VOC Index with color indicator |
| AUDIO | INMP441 | 8-band EQ visualizer (canvas, peak-hold) + waveform oscilloscope + RMS level |

The header shows a live clock, date, and hardcoded location coordinates.  All readings have LED color indicators (green → lime → amber → red) based on health thresholds.

## API

Base URL: `http://<pi-hostname>:8000`

All endpoints except `/api/health` require `X-API-Key: <key>` (set in `/etc/home-monitor.env`). The dashboard at `/` is served without authentication.

| Method    | Path                              | Description                              |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| GET       | `/api/health`                     | Broker connectivity and uptime (no auth) |
| GET       | `/api/version`                    | Service version and git commit           |
| GET       | `/api/sensors`                    | Latest readings from all sensors         |
| GET       | `/api/sensors/{sensor_id}`        | Latest reading for one sensor (200/404/503) |
| GET       | `/api/sensors/{sensor_id}/status` | Staleness + connectivity metadata        |
| WebSocket | `/api/ws/audio/stream`            | Real-time `AudioStreamPayload` at ~20 Hz |

WebSocket authentication: `?api_key=<key>` query parameter.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
pip install pytest ruff
pytest          # 283 tests, all pass without hardware
ruff check .    # linting
```
